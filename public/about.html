<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sajan Nair. By profession I am a marketeer and an advertising person. However, over the years I have added a
  lot many new skills to my repertoire. After a successful stint across some of the top global network agencies, I quit
  my job and stared out on my own. I chose to focus on what I liked the most during my stint with advertising. Which was
  content creation.</p>

<p>Ours was a full spectrum agency that specialised in written content and video content. Over time we also specialised
  in emerging technologies like AR/VR and stereoscopic content. You can take a look at our video content <a
    href="https://vimeo.com/user7269573">HERE.</a> If you like
  what you see and would like some content created for you or your brand please don't hesitate to give us a buzz. You
  can find my details on the Contact Me section.</p>

<p>I also used to maintain a couple of personal blogs as well. One in the travel space and one in the food space. To be
  honest the food bit was mostly my wifeâ€™s recipes. While the blogs are not around anymore, I did keep a backup of the
  same on the blockchain and you can check them out <a href="https://peakd.com/@sajannair/">HERE.</a></p>

<p>However, in 2020 when the pandemic hit, it gave me an opportunity to focus on my passion, which is technology. I was
  amazed at the power it had to change human life. An incident with my new android phone got me thinking about the
  importance
  of digital identities and I started out in that space. I found blockchain as a perfect platform to build a
  decentralised identity
  system for internet users worldwide. Our project <a href="https://agaamin.in">Agaamin</a> went into public beta on the
  1st of
  January 2022. Our stack is built on a blockchain called Handshake which serves as a decentralised DNS root zone of the
  internet. You can know
  more about Handshake <a href="https://handshake.org">HERE</a>.</p>


<p>So, what is this website doing here in middle of all this activity. Well, if I am going to play founder for a tech
  project then it's only natural that I too should know what I am talking about. And while I am quite good at technology
  and played a
  central role in developing our platform, I still could not code myself. I decided to fix that! So, I decided to take
  up a Full
  Stack Developer Course and this website is my first attempt at coding. You can find my github repo <a
