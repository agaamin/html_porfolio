<h1>The best movies as per Sajan</h1>
    <h2>My top 4 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Man from Earth</h3>
<p> This is a mind blowing movies that grips you from the word go.</p>
<h3>Spy Game</h3>
<p>Brad Pitt and Robert Redford at their best. A perfect spy thriller.</p>
<h3>Zeitgesit Addendum</h3>
<p>Not exactly a movie. More of a documentory but just as gripping as watchable</p>
<h3>Fire in the blood</h3>
<p> Another documentory on generic medicines. <br />
    Watch how big pharma put profits over humans.</p>
